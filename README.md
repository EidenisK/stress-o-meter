## The Project  

Nuotraukytes  

"Stress-O-Meter" is a students best friend or his worst nightmare. By filling a short quiz and giving your timetable to "Stress-O-Meter", the predictions of your emotional level are visualized on a calendar. At various days of the month the stress level might differ. If the day is a weekend or just does not have any assignments to do, then a vivid green will catch your eye. If there is a long, hard working day or an exam, then probably that week is blazing red. But that is not the end of "Stress-O-Meter's" capabilities:  
* Obiously, "Stress-O-Meter" provides a calendar that is painted accordingly to your busyness and emotional health: red meaning very stressful time, while green meaning total relaxation  
* "Stress-O-Meter" gives advices how to cope with stress and even reduce it  
* "Stress-O-Meter" has a chating function, so that the stressed ones can seek moral support and those, who are slacking off, provided that  
* "Stress-O-Meter" for user's interests can show stress prevalence on the map, so the loneliness is thrown out of the window. Or not...
